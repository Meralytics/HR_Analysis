In this project, we employ Power BI for an in-depth data analysis journey. From basic visualizations and filtering to some DAX calculations and custom visualizations, each task contributes to a holistic understanding of the dataset. Our goal is to extract actionable insights, fostering a data-driven approach to decision-making.
